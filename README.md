Hello

Welcome to the final projects repository. This repository holds all of my final data science projects. 

For now, only the Dota 2 project is available since this is my only end to end data science project. 
This project was used to satisfy the requirements for the Springboard Foundations of Data Science course.
The project was completed in R, with a R markdown final report and presentation.

Below links give you access to the R code, markdown final report, kaggle link to source data and the modified 
datasets used in the markdown. These links will ensure that my code and outputs are completely reproducible.
